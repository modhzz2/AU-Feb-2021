Natural join:
A natural join joins two table names on the basis of same attribute(column) names. Unlike other joins, it does not require the user to explicitly specify the 
columns on which the joins are to be made.
Ex.
In case you want roll numbers of all the students that got scholarship(which will be evident if their roll nos are in the scholarship table), then you would use a 
natural join and you will obtain their rollnos.

Left outer join:
A left outer join lists all the records from the first table even though we do not find a match while joining it with the second table.
Ex.
Now, if you want to know how many students in your school got scholarship(which will be evident if their roll nos are in the scholarship table) as well as the ones 
who did not receive it and then alert all the students then you can use left outer join. Because, even if we do not find a match in the scholarship table we have to 
contact them so we need their mobile numbers.

Right outer join:
A right outer join lists all the records from the second table even though we do not find a match while joining it with the first table.



Full outer join:
A full outer join lists all the records from both the tables even though we do not find a match with the other table.
Ex.
Suppose we have 2 tables 'A' and 'B' and we have to find how many total entries are present without overcounting. In this case, we can use the full outer join as this
join would not recount already matched rows.
