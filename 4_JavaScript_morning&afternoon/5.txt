'==' tests for equality after converting both sides to compatible types.
For example, 
3=="3" will return true even though one is a string and the other one is a integer.





'===' tests for equality without any type conversions(as it is) 
For example, 
3==="3" will return false.
It is more strict. It should be preferred.
